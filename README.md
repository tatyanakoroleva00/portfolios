These are all websites (personal and made with free templates).
1. Flowers_website - My first personal website (I modified it in the next same-named file). I added a new design, got rid of some animated hover effects, turn the visual map into a link. 
2. Flower_website_new_design - The second attempt of the same website. Colours are softer. 
3. MoGO website. I make it with free templates. In Photoshop, I find the necessary info about the text style, line-heights, margins and paddings, download photos pre-loaded pics. The whole website is done. It took me 4 days. It is a 10 pages website.
