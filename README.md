These are all websites (personal and made with free templates *FT). 
!Important Placed in the order of creation. 

01. Flowers_website - My first personal website (I modified it in the next same-named file). I added a new design, got rid of some animated hover effects, turn the visual map into a link. Time: 2days.
01-2. Flower_website_new_design - The second attempt of the same website. Colours are softer. 
02. MoGO website. I make it with free templates. In Photoshop, I find the necessary info about the text style, line-heights, margins and paddings, download photos pre-loaded pics. The whole website is done. It is a 10 pages website. My high speed of typing and knowledge of English + computer intuition & logics help me much. Time: 3 days. 
03. Watches website. It was a free template website. I've already done it once with the help of some YouTube blogger. Now, it was my attempt to do it. Time: 1h30 mins.
04. Pipernet_is_here - The website from the site Stepik.org. Free Template. Time: 2h.
05. FT_John. Free template website.
